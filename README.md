# My-Portfolio
# 📊 Logistic Regression Project

This project demonstrates how logistic regression can be used to classify data and predict binary outcomes. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## 🧠 Objective

To build a logistic regression model that accurately predicts whether a parcel will be delivered on time or delayed using a dataset with multiple features.
